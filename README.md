# Credit-Risk-Assessment
Problem Statement: Develop a credit risk assessment framework that uses historical loan data and probabilistic/statistical analysis. The goal is to identify and evaluate the risk of loan default and dynamically update this risk using Bayesian inference.

Objective of Code:
Develop a credit risk assessment framework using historical loan data that combines EDA, probability/statistics (like Bayesian Inference), and a Logistic Regression ML Model to predict loan default risk.

# Credit Risk Assessment using Probability, Bayesian Inference, and Machine Learning

This project demonstrates a framework for credit risk assessment using historical loan data. It integrates traditional data analysis with probabilistic modeling and machine learning (Logistic Regression) to predict loan defaults.

## Key Components:
- Data Preprocessing & Cleaning
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Probability Distribution Fitting
- Risk Profiling & Scoring (Custom Buckets)
- Bayesian Updating of Default Probabilities
- Logistic Regression Model (Baseline ML Model)

## Folder Structure:
- `/data`: Sample datasets [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/wordsforthewise/lending-club]
- `/notebooks`: I used VS Code
- `/src`: Python scripts modularizing preprocessing, EDA, risk profiling, Bayesian updating, and ML modeling
- `/outputs`: Risk profiled datasets and visualizations
